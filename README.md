# Cleaning Data with Dato

Solid Saturday Stat Study with Dato & Python. I recently discovered
Dato after seeing one of their [Events](https://dato.com/events/) posted
on Twitter and have been enjoying learning more about how to use their
platform tools for rapid and powerful Machine Learning prototyping.

This repo reflects my open thoughts following along with one of the lessons
found in the [Dato Gallery](https://dato.com/learn/gallery/).

## Cleaning Messy Data

As we read in numerous blogs or in any conversation that you may have with
anyone that works with data regularly, it would be wonderful if all data came
to us in precisely the format we would like so we could immediately begin diving
into all of the super exciting analyses, visualizations, etc. that we love. But,
this is rarely the case and we need tools in our toolkit to help us with our
[data munging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling) tasks.
